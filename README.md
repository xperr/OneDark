# OneDark - Dark mode for OneDrive

This extension is a must-have if you are a user of OneDrive. 
To this day, OneDrive does not support dark-mode for normal users (why microsoft..? ). 
Anyways, the dark theme looks much better and it's better for your eyes. 

Please keep in mind that I don't really have any experience in coding and that this extension is still in very early beta, so you will see bugs pretty often.
